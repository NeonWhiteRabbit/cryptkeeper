<h1>Usage</h1>
  
<H2>REQUIREMENTS TO ENCRYPT ENTIRE FOLDERS:</H2>
1. Copy contents to the 'grave' folder to encrypt everything inside of it. Encrypted files maintain their folder structure, and can be decrypted individually or all at once.<p>
2. To decrypt multiple files at once, put them in the 'encrypted' folder prior to running. A new folder called 'decrypted' will be made, with the decrypted contents inside.<p>

 TO RUN:<p>

  ./cryptkeeper.sh<p>
